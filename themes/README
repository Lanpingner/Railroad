Basically, this is only temporary.

These themes will later on be installed with the installer into %APPDATA%\Roaming\Railroad\themes\
and then the options will come from then and users can create their own, but due to there being a PR for theming
and the installer isn't done, I'll leave it as is to not confuse people.

When moving the themes to the appdata folder (NOT YET), the themes will stay on github to make it easier to download them
but they will need to be moved to the appdata folder to be used.
